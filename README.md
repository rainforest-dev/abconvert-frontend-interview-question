## Requirements

- You must use Next.js and Tailwind CSS to build the project.

- You may use any additional libraries, **but UI libraries that do not integrate with Tailwind CSS are not allowed.**

- The project should follow the same theme as the [Venue theme](https://venue-theme-morning.myshopify.com/).

  - Images are not importantâ€”you may use placeholder images. however, the product page should have a product image which we have provided in the assets folder.

- Product data will be provided in the assets folder.

- While this is a frontend-focused challenge, you should write backend code if necessary (e.g., for SSR/SSG or handling API requests).

- Deploy the project to a publicly accessible URL.

- Extra features that go beyond the requirements and impress us are encouraged!

## Project Description

This is a minimalistic e-commerce project built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

### Task 1: E-Commerce Website

- [Collection page](https://venue-theme-morning.myshopify.com/collections/accessories)

### Bonus Task: A/B Test Recommendation Engine

Create an A/B test recommendation engine that suggests the best recommendations for users.

- The implementation should replicate the functionality of [Weblens AI](https://weblens.ai/).

- Concrete system flow:

  - Implement a system to scrape a your website which you built in the first task.
  - Utilize AI to determine if there are any elements suitable for A/B testing.
  - Develop an effective method to present the results.
